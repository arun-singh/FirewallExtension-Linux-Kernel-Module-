# FirewallExtension-Linux-Kernel-Module-
A kernel module that allows / blocks programs on specified ports

This was created for my operating systems module in my third year of study.

The files include a userspace program firewallSetup.c and a kernel module firewallExtension.c (.ko when MakeFile executed).
